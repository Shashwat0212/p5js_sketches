# It's Shiffman time!!!!

## Story Time :
Being an **undergraduate** I was exploring a lot of stuff to put hands on when I came across **The Coding Train's** [you-tube](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) channel. 
The content I came across was overwhelming, accurate and fun to watch and I wish any new programmer or tech enthusiast to reach out to his content on you-tube to enjoy coding and exploring new stuff as I've learned from him The man - **_Daniel Shiffman_**. He also gave me link to many other great channels on my topics of interest. **Love your work and Happy Coding**.

## Topic :
The sketches in the repository are **a true inspiration from daniel's tutorials** with some minor fixes and some experiments. 

### A* Pathfinding
A* is a search algorithm which is flexible and easy to apply algorithm because of it’s wide application from other search algorithms. It’s most preferable application and the part I love the most are videogames and from there it can be understood how this algorithm is applied on certain jobs like path finding in the context of game environment.
