# It's Shiffman time!!!!

## Story Time :
Being an **undergraduate** I was exploring a lot of stuff to put hands on when I came across **The Coding Train's** [you-tube](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) channel. 
The content I came across was overwhelming, accurate and fun to watch and I wish any new programmer or tech enthusiast to reach out to his content on you-tube to enjoy coding and exploring new stuff as I've learned from him The man - **_Daniel Shiffman_**. He also gave me link to many other great channels on my topics of interest. **Love your work and Happy Coding**.

## Topic :
The sketches in the repository are **a true inspiration from daniel's tutorials** with some minor fixes and some experiments. 

## Graph Algorithms
### A* Pathfinding
A* is a search algorithm which is flexible and easy to apply algorithm because of it’s wide application from other search algorithms. It’s most preferable application and the part I love the most are videogames and from there it can be understood how this algorithm is applied on certain jobs like path finding in the context of game environment.

## Fluid Dynamics
### Lorenz Attractor
The Lorenz system ([attractor](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Attractor.html))is a set of ordinary differential equations and as name suggests was first studied by [Edward Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz). The simulation which you will go through is kind of chaotic and since the equations are in three variables the simulation hence has a three dimensional span and you can pan it through your mouse.
